#Mathew C. Martin: Portfolio of work

##Ongoing quest for knowledge and understanding through the application of empirical methodology and critical thinking skills.

###Setting: "You are Here!"

We are empowered in this age to both capture the spoken word and the stories of our shared humanity; while at the very same time, at risk of losing this robust and intrinsic human gift. Our love and acceptance of technology is seemingly at an all time high with advances making real previously unimagined possibilities, yet, paradoxically we look around the coffee shop or on the bus and people have at the very same time given these tools, much like the writing "quill" of old, power in supplanting our oral traditions. We have found easy sanctuary from human connections reliant on tools to convey the knowledge and information we all hold. Where once the collective mind held the secrets passed around the hearth or perhaps at most, etched in stone, we now rely almost entirely on other computational means to pass on the knowledge for which humanity once was more mindful and deliberate than a password and pin; for which, we now entrust nearly all we own.

Yet, we are wise to not blame the tool for our own lack of passion and delight. How we manage our time here is what most defines us as the unique individuals we claim to be. Only when we gain the knowledge to bend space and step back, then perhaps we can regain what we've lost, until then forward through the one constant we can depend. Which leads me to my point, one defined by numbers in space, not time. Geometry lies at the heart of geography, as its mathematic principles are much the same. My focus of study and much of my life experience and has been in both cartography and computer science. Communicating information and witnessing the evolution from analog to digital has been my life for so long it is far to boring to tell. At least unless you have a hearth... or perhaps a quill.

Finding a model to think about representing our world is an age old problem. Often the first step would be agreeing on some standard framework. For instance, a currency standard or even better, the language with which we effectively communicate. Is our model exclusive of other languages or do we accept the reality that not everyone communicates in our language? Already we see our model getting more and more complex. Who keeps the records anyway? Do you keep the record for me or should I be cautious and retain my own. As humans we process this complexity rather easily and generally with some grace and dignity. The framework and tools allowing us to seamlessly glide thru transparent fields of electromagnetism exchanging data both ways. Discarding almost all the energy required for the information exchange which perhaps back in the day might have burned up an entire forest... just to say "Good day!"

In my lifetime I've witnessed an evolution going the other way. For society the advent of imagery and sound pumped into our homes has been quite profound. The complete immersion of our senses lacking only smell and taste at this date. While at university, in my study of the Vietnam War, it was quite clear to me that news reels showing the true face of war and the to date unseen atrociousness forced societal change from what previously was perceived as justifiable. Yet, today so much information surrounds us that a single newsworthy broadcast by a reputable professional journalist would likely garner a tiny fraction of what was once thought impactful. Not only does a single family not sit down for the same broadcast but it is unlikely that they consume media in the same way.

When I was a very young child in the 70's, I have clear recollection of the games we played. Very popular at the time was a complex game which used dice roles to guide an adventure. Called "Dungeons & Dragons" it had power over my young imagination in a very profound and lasting way. It gave rise to my desire to create worlds in which I could play. Yet it existed only within the framework of my creativity and the rules of play. A good friend named Ricky Ayers, who had a couple cool older brothers, had a slumber party where we played and his older brother acted as dungeon master. It had a lasting impression on me, how he was able to create a picture in my mind thru his words alone, and his imagination provided me with a world in which to however briefly stay.

Not to long after this experience Ricky and his brothers all passed away. It is hard to lose a friend at such a young age. Yet, the brief time we spent together still lasts to this day. The randomness of it all still rings slightly hollow. At the very least, an appreciation for chaos was formed. Those dice have always reminded me of Ricky and his brothers and how random is life's play. It is not the game or the media or the tools with which we play that lasts beyond our day. Rather it is the imagination and heart we put into life that yields a legacy beyond the grave. Making the game easier to play still intrigues me today. Given the lessons it teaches, a random dice roll is as good as any in understanding, mathematics, physics, computer science, and physical dimensions in an abstraction of space and time. A place up to our imagination to fill and that is a quest in and of itself. Finding my place... like a map with a sign "You Are Here" and filling that void with light and beauty will be fun and can be done with a few humble platitudes and a whole lot of grace.

###Icosahedron Plan: Create a single page website that incorporates a icosahedron (20 sided polygon) animation spinning on a single axis using a .json file created in Blender and Blend4web to render it into my portfolio page.

            Stretch Goals:
                        _ Create a library of polygon .json files including a simple cube as well as the other common dice used in D&D.
                        _ Add a randomized number to the face.
                        _ Get dice to spin on more than a single access to more accurately depict the physics of a real dice role.

###Photo library plan: Create a single page website for my portfolio using Google Arts and Culture API and a gallery of images pinned on a simple static google map to depict those images using their relative location data.

              1. Obtained KHS board approval for Google Arts and Culture API access request. ~ Done!
              2. Create a gallery using those tools once access is granted by google. ~ In process.
              3. Pin photos onto a static map and link the images. ~ Goal
              4. Model best practice for other small non-profit organizations interested in hosting "Fun Photo Contests" to enhance their communities in interactive maps. ~ Stretch Goal

###Paradoxically these two things seem to contradict each other. Yet, seemingly in my mind the randomness and unexplained remain fun just the same.

              1. Voluntary role as VP of KHS is being 'upgraded' to President due health issues with current President.
              2. It would be fun to accomplish two tasks in one given time constraint and positive interpersonal and community development gained thru public goodwill concurrent with Code Fellows mission and the provisions of my diversity grant.
              3. If I could display images on a spinning icosahedron, my lead TA Liz will understand that my seemingly crazy visions and headstrong actions, meet gloriously spinning in life's chaos with a long long legacy of humble giving and beautiful and meaningful game play.
              4. To locate fun places and share meaningful ideas in common dialog and provided a guide in the form of a map to those places seems a humble and informed way.
              5. To give light to imagination outside a Dungeon is a far better play! But if it is Dragons you seek, choose your API wisely and your weapon of choice should be sharper than C. The secret map is no secret I have found, it is only hard work and struggle if you want to take the crown. Apparently there is plenty to go around but only with good intent and and altruistic bent will our endeavors last beyond this month's rent. Code on good fellows, only our imagination marks the boundaries of this realm.
